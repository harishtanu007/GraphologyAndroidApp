Graphology is the science of studying an individual’s personality traits through analysing the patterns formed in the writing.

Upload a sample of your handwriting to know what my Graphology tool tells about you!

Android App Workflow:
Colors and images in the app are collected from the Graphology Website http://graphology.eastus.azurecontainer.io/graphology/index

Home Page:

When the user clicks on “self evaluate” Button, it will open google form in the Android Web browser. 

After Form submission user needs to go back to the home page of the app by clicking on the “Back button.”

When the user clicks on “submit sample” Button, it will open the Email activity page where the user needs to provide the email address, which he has submitted in the Graphology Google Form.

Email Activity Page:

After entering the email address, the user will click on the “submit” button. This will open the Upload Images page where the user needs to upload images. 
The Unique ID is retrieved from the Graphology google sheets by using email ID as the key.
Clicks on the “Upload Image 1” to upload images.

Upload Images Page:

Users can select images either from camera or gallery.



If the user selects “Take a picture,” it will take the user to Camera Activity.



If the user selects “Choose from gallery,” it will take the user to the gallery to choose images.

After selecting the images, they will be shown with the file names.
 

Then the user clicks on submit Button. This will upload the files into the Graphology servers.

Once the Response is obtained from the server user will be taken to the Results Page.
The Response obtained from the Graphology servers is in the form of HTML code, So I have just used the Html code in the Web view to show the results
